Summary: A table displaying income groups in percentages, average income amounts, average total tax rates, share of all taxes, and share of all income. Income groups range from the lowest 20% to the top 1%, with corresponding average incomes from $13,500 to $1,462,000, tax rates from 18.8% to 33.0%, and shares of taxes and income detailed for each group.

Graph illustrating the supply and demand for coffee, showing the impact of a tax on supply. Key points include:

- Price of coffee on the vertical axis ($ per cup).
- Quantity of coffee supplied per week on the horizontal axis.
- Original supply curve (Supply₀) and new supply curve after tax (SupplyTax).
- Demand curve intersecting at equilibrium points (E₀ and ETax).
- Indication of a shortage at the price of $1.40.
-----------
Graph illustrating the impact of a tax on supply and demand. It features two supply curves: the original supply curve (Supply₀) and the taxed supply curve (Supplyₜₐₓ). Key points include equilibrium points (E₀ and Eₜₐₓ), prices (P₀, P₁, Pₜₐₓ), and quantities (Q₀ and Qₜₐₓ). The graph shows how the tax shifts the supply curve and affects equilibrium price and quantity.
-----------
Graph illustrating the impact of a tax on supply and demand. It features two supply curves (Supply₀ and Supplyₜₐₓ) and one demand curve. Key points include equilibrium points (E₀ and Eₜₐₓ), prices (P₀, Pₜₐₓ, P₁), and quantities (Q₀ and Qₜₐₓ). The graph shows how the tax shifts the supply curve and affects equilibrium price and quantity.

Graph illustrating the supply and demand for coffee, showing the impact of a supply tax. The vertical axis represents the price per cup of coffee, with a price of $1.33 marked. The horizontal axis indicates the quantity of coffee supplied per week, ranging from 625 to 700 cups. Two supply curves are depicted: the original supply curve (Supply₀) and the new supply curve after tax (SupplyTax). Equilibrium points E₀ and ETax are marked, with a highlighted area indicating a price increase of $0.30 due to the tax.

Table comparing inelastic and elastic demand characteristics, including changes in price, quantity sold, tax revenues, and tax burden.
-----------
Graph illustrating the effects of a tax on supply and demand. It features two supply curves (Supply_0 and Supply_Tax) and one demand curve. Key points include equilibrium points (E_0 and E_Tax), prices (P_0, P_Tax, P_1), and quantities (Q_0, Q_Tax). The graph highlights the shifts in supply due to taxation and the resulting changes in equilibrium price and quantity.

-----------
Summary: The image presents a tax calculation table detailing total income of $49,000, with deductions for nontaxable income ($10,000) and retirement contributions ($2,000), resulting in a taxable income of $37,000. It breaks down income taxed at different rates (10%, 15%, and 25%) and lists the total income tax owed as $5,178.75.

Line graph depicting the percentage of GDP attributed to Total Taxes, Federal Taxes, and State and Local Taxes from 1950 to 2010. Total Taxes (gray line) show a gradual increase, Federal Taxes (blue line) fluctuate around 20%, and State and Local Taxes (black line) remain relatively stable, around 10-15%.
-----------
Bar chart comparing total taxes as a percentage of GDP across various countries, including Mexico, Turkey, the United States, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Denmark. The chart shows a gradual increase in tax percentages from Mexico (lowest) to Denmark (highest).

Line graph depicting the top marginal federal income tax rate in the United States from 1950 to 2010. The graph shows a significant decline from around 90% in the early 1950s to 1.7% by 2010, with notable percentages highlighted in various years: 4.2% in 1954, 4.4% in 1964, 3.3% in 1974, 3.1% in 1984, 3.2% in 1994. The background features alternating light blue shaded areas representing different decades.
